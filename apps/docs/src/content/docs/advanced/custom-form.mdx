import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

import customFormCode from '@/components/custom-form.ts?raw';

Even with a simple setup, resulting code is very verbose.
Therefore, after choosing a theme, validator and translation, it is convenient to create a wrapper around the `useForm`.

<Code code={customFormCode} lang="typescript" title="custom-form.ts" />
