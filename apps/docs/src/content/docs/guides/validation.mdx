By default form data will be validated by HTML5 validation and provided validator only on submission.

:::tip

To disable HTML5 validation pass `novalidate` attribute to the form element.

## Live validation (not recommended)

By utilizing Svelte 5 reactivity, we can easily implement live validation.

<Code code={liveValidationCode} lang="svelte" />

<Card>
  <LiveValidation />
</Card>

While it is possible, this approach has low efficiency, because usually
revalidation of the whole form when changing one field does not make sense.

## Inputs validation

Instead of full form revalidation, we propose to perform revalidation of only the input field and full validation of the form when submitting.

<Code code={inputsValidationCode} lang="svelte" />

<Card>
  <InputsValidation />
</Card>

The form in this example will only revalidate input fields on the `input` and `change` events after the first submission of the form.

<LinkCard title="Inputs validation mode API reference" href="../../api-reference/inputs-validation-mode/" />

## Focus on first error

You can achieve focus on the first error by using the `focusOnFirstError` function.

<Code code={focusOnFirstErrorCode} lang="svelte" />

<Card>
  <FocusOnFirsError />
</Card>

1. `focusOnFirstError` will try to find a focusable element and focus it.
2. If it's not found, it will try to find an errors list and scroll it into view.
3. If it's not found, it will return `false`.
