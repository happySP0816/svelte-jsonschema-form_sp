You can achieve focus on the first error by using the `focusOnFirstError` function.

## Usage

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Form } from "@sjsf/form";
  import { focusOnFirstError } from '@sjsf/form/focus-on-first-error';
</script>

<Form {...} onSubmitError={focusOnFirstError} />
```

## Explanation

1. `focusOnFirstError` will try to find a focusable element and focus it.
2. If it's not found, it will try to find an errors list and scroll it into view.
3. If it's not found, it will return `false`.
