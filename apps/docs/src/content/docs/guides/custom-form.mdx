import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

import customFormCode from '@/components/custom-form.svelte?raw';

Even with a simple setup, resulting code is very verbose.
Therefore, after choosing a theme, validator and translation, it is convenient to create a custom component.

Unfortunately, right now, passing bindable props in Svelte 5 is also very verbose.

<Code code={customFormCode} lang="svelte" title="custom-form.svelte" />
