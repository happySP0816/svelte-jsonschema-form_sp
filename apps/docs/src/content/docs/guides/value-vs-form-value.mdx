Once a form is created, you have access to its state through the `value` and `formValue` properties.
Let's take a look at their areas of application:

`value: T | undefined`

- Intended for use by the user
- Maintains the consistency of the form state
  - Returns a snapshot of the form state
  - The update takes into account the default values from the JSON Schema

`formValue: SchemaValue | undefined`

- Intended for use by the library
- Direct access to the form state
